    "\n",
    "#Why Strings are Immutable?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Efficiency: Python reuses string objects to save memory. For example, if two variables have the same string, they can point to the same object in memory. If strings were mutable, modifying one variable could unintentionally change another.\n",
    "2. Hashing: Strings are used as keys in dictionaries because they are immutable and hashable. If strings could change, their hash value would also change, breaking the dictionary functionality.\n",

    "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries offer several advantages over lists for specific tasks because they store data in key-value pairs. Here are some key advantages with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Faster Lookups:\n",
    "Dictionaries allow quick access to data using keys, whereas lists require searching through all elements.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using a list\n",
    "items = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "print(\"banana\" in items)  # Searches through the entire list\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using a dictionary\n",

    "print(\"banana\" in items_dict)  # Directly checks the key, faster\n",

    "2. Descriptive Keys:\n",
    "Dictionaries let you use meaningful keys to organize data, making the code easier to understand.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using a list (hard to understand what each index means)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. No Duplicate Keys:\n",
    "Dictionaries automatically prevent duplicate keys, ensuring unique identifiers for each value.\n",
    "Example:\n",

    "# List can have duplicates\n",
    "items = [\"apple\", \"apple\", \"banana\"]\n",

    "# Dictionary prevents duplicate keys\n",
    "items_dict = {\"apple\": 2, \"banana\": 1}  # \"apple\" key occurs only once\n",
    "\n",

    "Dictionaries are better for representing relationships between data.\n",
    "Example:\n",
